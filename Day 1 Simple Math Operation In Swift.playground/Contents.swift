// 3.Create a 3rd variable that stores that sum of the 1st and 2nd variables (20 should print to the screen)
// 4.Create a 4th variable that stores the result of a multiplication operation - the stored result should be equal to 45
// 5.Create a 5th variable that stores the result of the 1st variable minus the 2nd variable - the result should be 10
